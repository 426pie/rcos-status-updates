## Last Week's Accomplishments

This previous week, we continued researching, on what we want to work on. 
However, we planned ahead and expected it to take a while to figure out 
where we want to start.

## This Week's Plan

We plan on continue to research on different design choices for operating 
systems, and hopefully complete some hands-on guides to get started.

## Anything Blocking?

Currently, there is a big knowledge gap between what we know now, and what 
we need to know to complete this project. However, like I mentioned before, 
we anticipated this and schedueled our timeline accordingly.
