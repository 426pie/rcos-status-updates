I am currently continueing looking at documentation. Specifically
I am looking at:
https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master/01-bootsector-barebones. 
I have my enviorment mostly set up, and am installing more things as I go along.
I have a very simple bootloader using qemu that doesn't do much work, but there 
is proof that it is working.
